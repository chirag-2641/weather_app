It is a weather application that utilizes weather APIs to provide real-time weather information for different locations and current Geo-location of the user.
The app allows users to input the name of a city or location and retrieves accurate weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Key features and technologies utilized in this project include:

1)HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The front-end of the application was developed using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and API integration.

2)Weather API Integration: I integrated a weather API (eg-OpenWeatherMap.org/api) to fetch current weather data for the specified location.

3)Dynamic Weather Display: Upon entering a location, the app dynamically retrieves weather information and displays it in a visually appealing and informative manner.

4)Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
